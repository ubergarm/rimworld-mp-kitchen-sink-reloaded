## v0.5
* remove Fluffy's Work Tab as it seemed to be causing frozen pawns/mechanoids/animals and making clients unable to join while dev log spammed errors. removing it seems to fix.
* remove Fluffy's Mod Manager as it is not recommended on RimWorld Multiplayer Discord
* remove EDB Prepare Carefully as it is not recommended on RimWorld Multiplayer Discord
* remove Gloomy Face mk2 because it seems to overwrite vanilla faces instead of giving additional options
* remove Dub's Paint Shop because we don't use it and it adds complexity
* remove Designator Shapes because we don't use it much and it adds complexity (and flood fill may be a loose stair)
* add Character Editor - don't edit items in MP saves. can use this to bootstrap friends characters into a game etc.
* change config on Smart Medicine to enable stocking up from pawns gear menu (didn't desync in testing)

## v0.4
* remove reinforced structures (already have embrasures for all in concrete walls mod and less obnoxious research)
* considered tiered concrete but went with known and trusted concrete walls
* add vanilla psycasts expanded
* remove choice of psycasts
* considered vpe biotech integration (skipped it as gets too complex for my n00b tastes and untested)
* considered vpe biotech integration for alpha animals and more (alpha animals already has this it seems?)

## v0.3
* add [fsf] complex jobs
* add electric stonecutting table
* remove lights out (seems fine, but just more jobs for pawns to do leave the lights on lol, also have time-of-day switches)
* tweak configs faction interaction to dial back pirate expanding chance (as we have 3 pirate factions)
* tweak configs colony groups for a nice 5x red to green hex code mood color bar
* considered CM Color Coded Mood Bar (but passed as colony groups does enough)
* consider better pawn control over compositable loadouts (unfortunately, bpc is not likely MP compat)

## v0.2
* add Cherry Picker
* cherry pick remove medicines+ hypnotol
* cherry pick remove vanilla hair expanded barber table
* cherry pick remove alpha genetics ocular affinity (ocular jellyfish may desync)
* remove Settlements Quests
* remove Yayo Addon
* remove RT Solar Shield
* remove Solar Shield Retexture
* remove misc. robots as mechinators can do it all now
* remove stabilize here (psure vanilla does this if drafted w/ meds in pawn inventory?) (smart medicine has something too??)
* remove (Multiplayer Compatible) No Skill Decay (seems fine, but given xenotype +8 aptitude helps reduce decay etc)
* remove Pets can Eat from Wall Refrigerator (it isn't tested and seems too risky for the limited gain)
* remove Vanilla Skills Expanded (seems cool, but kind of redundant with xenotype aptitudes and the new passion types don't show up in work tab psure)

## v0.1
* initial test
