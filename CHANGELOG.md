## v0.2
* add Cherry Picker
* cherry pick remove medicines+ hypnotol
* cherry pick remove vanilla hair expanded barber table
* remove Settlements Quests
* remove Yayo Addon
* remove RT Solar Shield
* remove Solar Shield Retexture
* remove misc. robots as mechinators can do it all now
* remove stabilize here (psure vanilla does this if drafted w/ meds in pawn inventory?) (smart medicine has something too??)
* remove (Multiplayer Compatible) No Skill Decay (seems fine, but given xenotype +8 aptitude helps reduce decay etc)
* remove Pets can Eat from Wall Refrigerator (it isn't tested and seems too risky for the limited gain)
* remove Vanilla Skills Expanded (seems cool, but kind of redundant with xenotype aptitudes and the new passion types don't show up in work tab psure)

## v0.1
* initial test
