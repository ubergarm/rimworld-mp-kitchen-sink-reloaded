## v0.3
* add [fsf] complex jobs
* add electric stonecutting table
* remove lights out (seems fine, but just more jobs for pawns to do leave the lights on lol, also have time-of-day switches)
* tweak configs faction interaction to dial back pirate expanding chance (as we have 3 pirate factions)
* tweak configs colony groups for a nice 5x red to green hex code mood color bar
* considered CM Color Coded Mood Bar (but passed as colony groups does enough)
* consider better pawn control over compositable loadouts (unfortunately, bpc is not likely MP compat)

## v0.2
* add Cherry Picker
* cherry pick remove medicines+ hypnotol
* cherry pick remove vanilla hair expanded barber table
* cherry pick remove alpha genetics ocular affinity (ocular jellyfish may desync)
* remove Settlements Quests
* remove Yayo Addon
* remove RT Solar Shield
* remove Solar Shield Retexture
* remove misc. robots as mechinators can do it all now
* remove stabilize here (psure vanilla does this if drafted w/ meds in pawn inventory?) (smart medicine has something too??)
* remove (Multiplayer Compatible) No Skill Decay (seems fine, but given xenotype +8 aptitude helps reduce decay etc)
* remove Pets can Eat from Wall Refrigerator (it isn't tested and seems too risky for the limited gain)
* remove Vanilla Skills Expanded (seems cool, but kind of redundant with xenotype aptitudes and the new passion types don't show up in work tab psure)

## v0.1
* initial test
