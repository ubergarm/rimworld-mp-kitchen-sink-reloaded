Suggested DLC:
* Royalty
* Biotech

Multiplayer:
* Zetrith's Multiplayer Mod

A few years have gone by and now its time to try again. This modpack is
a slightly less ambitious updated reload of a previous pack that never
stopped desync'ing.

## Installation

1. Click `Subscribe to all` on the ![Steam](https://i.imgur.com/XEAiSka.png) [Mod Collection](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3174706609) (like and favorite if you choose)

TODO: Address pinning versions so nothing changes during a play-through...

## Loose Stairs
Known source of desyncs:

* RimHud - don't click self-tend toggle in RIMHud UI - use Health Tab button instead!??
* Alpha Genes - don't use string genes to transmit genes to selected target (is bugged, only xfers names but not genes)??
* More Faction Interaction - Avoid Help With Harvest, Diplomatic Marriage, Annual Expo Event (disable this one in config)
* Numbers - Hunt/Tame in Wildlife Tab causes desync (use the overworld gizmo instead)
* Vanilla Persona Weapons Expanded - changing persona weapon appearence causes desync, reachin baron/baroness and picking a custom persona weapon causes desync (have server do it alone and save)
* Vanilla Hair Expanded - don't use the barber table (removed it with cherrypicker)
* Set Up Camp - has bugs with multi-faction multiplayer mode (tested okay with normal mode)
* Smart Medicine - just to be safe I disabled stock-up in the configs, you can manually pickup some meds to your doc's inventory - maybe fixed but i'm being safe as it was an old issue psure
* Replace Stuff - don't use replace tool, just place new materials over old ones instead
* Grazing Lands - chance to destroy grass on consumption must remain 0% - just use default config and should be safe
* Follow Me - do *not* use the cinematic camera or RNG gets desynced
* Designator Shapes - "flood fill" causes desyncs
* Colony Groups - Group Menu -> Work -> Form Caravan desyncs, don't use any features except as a colonist bar replacement
* Work Tab - don't use favorites menu it may desync
* Yayo - not known for desyncs, but just to be safe use ammo as it is just too much more variables

## Unknown Quantities

* Tacticowl - it is listed as supported on MPCompat and its 3x base mods are compat
* Float Sub-menus - for the searchable menus, so must be okay
* Searchable Menus - working okay so far, looks great and works well!
* ResearchPal - 1.4 Repackage - so far so good in very limited testing

* Incident Person Stat (Continued) - seems okay, just adds more info to existing quest dialogues
* Holy Washer (Continued) - tested good
* Heat Map (Continued) - so far so good
